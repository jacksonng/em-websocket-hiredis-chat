Wanted to try out websockets/redis-pubsub

Created a localhost only chatter program.

to run:
please install redis version 2.0+ on your local machine and start ./redis-server with default config 

from project directory:
gem install bundler(if you don't have it)
bundle install
ruby sockie.rb

open up 2 seperate windows of index.html in a websocket compatible browser(ie Chrome)
start chatting!
